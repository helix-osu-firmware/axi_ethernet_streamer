ROM_form.vhd

Production template for a 1K program for KCPSM6 in a 7-Series device using a 
RAMB18E1 primitive.

Ken Chapman (Xilinx Ltd)

5th August 2011 - First Release
14th March 2013 - Unused address inputs on BRAMs connected High to reflect 
                  descriptions UG473.



This is a VHDL template file for the KCPSM6 assembler.

This VHDL file is not valid as input directly into a synthesis or a simulation tool.
The assembler will read this template and insert the information required to complete
the definition of program ROM and write it out to a new '.vhd' file that is ready for 
synthesis and simulation.

This template can be modified to define alternative memory definitions. However, you are 
responsible for ensuring the template is correct as the assembler does not perform any 
checking of the VHDL.

The assembler identifies all text enclosed by {} characters, and replaces these
character strings. All templates should include these {} character strings for 
the assembler to work correctly. 


--
Modified by P.S. Allison. Modified to allow for 8-bit read/write access into the BRAM
through the auxiliary port. Obviously this has the potential to do Horrible Things.
So be careful.

The next line is used to determine where the template actually starts.

-- Production definition of a 1K program for KCPSM6 in a 7-Series device using a 
-- RAMB18E1 primitive.
--
-- Note: The complete 12-bit address bus is connected to KCPSM6 to facilitate future code 
--       expansion with minimum changes being required to the hardware description. 
--       Only the lower 10-bits of the address are actually used for the 1K address range
--       000 to 3FF hex.  
--
-- Program defined by '{psmname}.psm'.
--
-- Generated by KCPSM6 Assembler: {timestamp}.

-- Assembler used ROM_form template: ROM_form_7S_1K_14March13.vhd
